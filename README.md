#Book Aggregator

A simple python project that aggregates book data from multiple sources (so far Google books and Open Library but can easily integrate more sources)

it searches the book by title and (optionally) author across the given platforms' APIs and returns a tabulated list of books with the title, author, source and link to it

Integrated GitHub Copilot to enhance the caching functionality of the program; critically evaluating the use of functool.lru_cache vs custom dictionary implementation for optimal performance.
